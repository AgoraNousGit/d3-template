# D3 Template

A minimal template for jump starting D3 Vis projects.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo or download the zip where you want it.
Then change into the cloned or unzipped folder.
Here's an example cloning the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:andyreagan/d3-template.git
mv d3-template my-new-project
cd my-new-project
# get rid of the template
\rm -rf .git
```

Start by launching the webserver with

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and hack away!


If you're hip and running `python3`, that would be `python3 -m http.server`.
Or if you have `node` installed, their `http-server` is more stable under many requests in my experience (but generally, not necessary).
